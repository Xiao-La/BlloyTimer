# BlloyTimer![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xiao-La/figures/master/imgs/favicon.png)

Forked from [AlloyTeam/AlloyTimer](https://github.com/AlloyTeam/AlloyTimer), adopted to my own tool.

The final goal is to create a tool that can record, supervise and analyse one's learning behaviours. 

## Todo

- renew the style

- add user manager and task record database

- add it to my website
